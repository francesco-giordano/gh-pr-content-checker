  skipLabels:
    description: | 
      "List of labels used to skip the check during a pull request. Each label name is comma separated and only one label needs to be 
      present for skip the check.

      For example, if `label-1,label-2` was supplied as the `skipLabels`, `label-1` _or_ `label-2` would skip the enforcer. 

      Each label is trimmed for leading and trailing spaces since GitHub labels do not allow for leading or trailing spaces. Thus, the following lists are equivalent:
      * `label-1,label-2`
      * `label-1 , label-2`
      * `label-1  ,label-2`"
